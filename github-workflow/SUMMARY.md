## 🎯 Key Features

### Dual-Track System

```
External PC → develop branch
   ↓
GitHub
   ↓
Internal Server (pull & test)
   ↓
Internal Server → internal branch (if fixes needed)
   ↓
GitHub
   ↓
External PC → Align develop + internal → main
   ↓
GitHub
   ↓
Internal Server → Deploy from main
```

### Safety Mechanisms

✅ **Internal Server CAN push** to `internal` branch  
✅ **Pre-push safety checklist** prevents data leaks  
✅ **Alignment step** prevents conflicts  
✅ **Main branch protected** (no direct pushes)  
✅ **Configuration-first** (same code, different .env)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Read Core Docs
- [README.md](README.md) - Overview
- [branch-strategy.md](branch-strategy.md) - Understand structure
- [quick-reference.md](quick-reference.md) - Keep handy

### 2. Setup (One Time)
- Follow [setup-instructions.md](setup-instructions.md)
- Configure [environment-config-guide.md](environment-config-guide.md)

### 3. Daily Use
- External PC: [external-workflow.md](external-workflow.md)
- Internal Server: [internal-workflow.md](internal-workflow.md)

### 4. When Needed
- Merge branches: [merge-alignment-guide.md](merge-alignment-guide.md)
- Fix conflicts: [conflict-resolution.md](conflict-resolution.md)
- Safety check: [safety-checklist.md](safety-checklist.md)

## 💡 What Problem This Solves

### Your Requirements:
1. ✅ **No direct push to main** - Protected via develop + internal buffer
2. ✅ **Internal can push** - Yes, to `internal` branch with safety checks
3. ✅ **Branch alignment** - Explicit merge & review before production
4. ✅ **Conflict avoidance** - Dual-track keeps changes separate until review
5. ✅ **Sensitive data protection** - Safety checklist & .env isolation
6. ✅ **Bidirectional flow** - Both environments can contribute changes
7. ✅ **Concise docs** - Each file focused, average 208 lines

### Traditional Approach Problems:
❌ Push directly to main → corrupts production  
❌ Internal can't contribute → bottleneck  
❌ No review step → conflicts surprise you  
❌ Config mixed with code → data leaks  

### This Workflow Solutions:
✅ Buffer branches protect main  
✅ Internal has own branch to push safely  
✅ Explicit alignment step catches conflicts early  
✅ Configuration isolated in .env files

## 🔄 Typical Week

**Monday-Wednesday:**
- External PC: Develop features on `develop` branch
- Push to GitHub regularly

**Thursday:**
- Internal Server: Pull `develop`, test with production environment
- Find issue → fix on `internal` branch → push to GitHub

**Friday:**
- External PC: Pull both `develop` + `internal`
- Review changes, merge `internal` → `develop`
- Test merged code
- Promote `develop` → `main`
- Push to GitHub

- Internal Server: Pull `main` → deploy to production

**Result:** Stable production release with contributions from both environments

## 📋 Branch Ownership

| Branch | Owner | Can Push? | Purpose |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| `main` | Both (via merge) | ❌ No direct | Production |
| `develop` | External PC | ✅ Yes | Development |
| `internal` | Internal Server | ✅ Yes (with checks) | Production fixes |
| `feature/*` | External PC | ✅ Yes | Features |

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### For Internal Server:
1. **Pre-push checklist** - Verify no sensitive data
2. **Separate branch** - Can't accidentally corrupt develop
3. **Review step** - External PC reviews before production
4. **Config isolation** - .env files never committed

### For External PC:
1. **Protected main** - Can't push directly
2. **Integration testing** - Merge to develop first
3. **Alignment review** - Check internal changes before merging
4. **Clear workflow** - Know exactly what to do
