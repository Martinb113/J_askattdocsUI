# Getting Started with GitHub Workflow

**Quick Start Guide**  
**For**: Managing j_askdocs application across Internal Server and External PC

---

## üéØ Quick Overview

You're managing **two environments** of the same application:

| Environment | Purpose | Location | Push to GitHub? |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **External PC** | Development | Your personal Windows PC | ‚úÖ Yes, freely |
| **Internal Server** | Testing/Production | Company server | ‚ö†Ô∏è No (pull only) |

**Key Principle**: Same code, different configuration files (.env)

---

## ‚ö° 5-Minute Setup

### **1. Setup External PC** (Development Environment)

```powershell
# You're already here!
cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\AI_projects\j_askdocs

# Create .env file from template
cd backend
copy env.development.template .env

# That's it! The .env file has safe development settings

# Start developing
cd ..
# Backend: uvicorn app.main:app --reload (in one terminal)
# Frontend: cd frontend && npm run dev (in another terminal)
```

### **2. Setup Internal Server** (Production Environment)

```bash
# Clone the repository on internal server
git clone https://github.com/Martinb113/J_askattdocsUI.git
cd J_askattdocsUI

# Create .env with production settings
cd backend
cp env.production.template .env

# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Edit .env with REAL company credentials
nano .env
# or: vim .env

# Set strict permissions (Linux)
chmod 600 .env

# Start the application
# ... start backend and frontend ...
```

## üöÄ Common Daily Tasks

### **Task 1: Start Your Development Day**

```powershell
# On External PC
cd C:\Users\admin\Documents\AI_projects\j_askdocs

# Pull any updates
git pull origin main

# Start working
# ... make changes ...

# When done for the day
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: What you did today"
git push origin main
```

### **Task 2: Update Internal Server with Your Changes**

```bash
# On Internal Server
cd /path/to/j_askdocs

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Restart services
# ... restart backend/frontend ...

# Test with production data
# ... manual testing ...
```

### **Task 3: Fix a Bug Found on Internal Server**

```powershell
# On External PC (safer to develop here)

# 1. Note what the bug is
# (Mental note or create a quick text file locally)

# 2. Try to reproduce locally
# ... test with development environment ...

# 3. Fix the code
# ... edit files ...

# 4. Test the fix
# ... verify it works ...

# 5. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Description of what was broken and how you fixed it"
git push origin main

# 6. Update Internal Server
# (On Internal: git pull origin main)
```

---

## üîí Safety Rules (CRITICAL!)

### **The Golden Rules**

1. **NEVER commit .env files** ‚ùå
   - They contain sensitive credentials
   - Use env.development.template and env.production.template instead

2. **Work on External PC for code changes** ‚úÖ
   - Safer environment
   - No risk of committing sensitive data
   - Better development tools

3. **Internal Server pulls only** ‚úÖ
   - Don't push code from Internal Server
   - Only pull changes from GitHub
   - Exception: Can push issue documentation (in future production workflow)

4. **Review before push** ‚úÖ
   - Always run `git status` and `git diff`
   - Make sure you're not committing anything sensitive
   - External PC: Quick review
   - Internal Server: VERY thorough review (if you must push)

5. **Keep .env files separate** ‚úÖ
   - External PC: Development settings (mock services)
   - Internal Server: Production settings (real credentials)
   - Never mix them up!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "Can't find .env file" or "Configuration error"**

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Create .env from template
cd backend
copy env.development.template .env

# Verify it exists
dir .env
```

### **Problem: "Git won't let me commit"**

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check what's wrong
git status

# If pre-commit hook is blocking, review the changes
git diff

# Make sure you're not committing sensitive data
# See SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md for detailed review
```

### **Problem: "Changes on Internal not showing on External"**

**Solution:**
```powershell
# On External PC, pull the changes
git pull origin main

# If there are no changes, Internal Server probably didn't push
# That's correct! Internal Server should only pull, not push
```

### **Problem: "Merge conflict"**

**Solution:**
```powershell
# See what's conflicting
git status

# If it's .env file - that shouldn't happen (it's ignored)
# If it's code, edit the file and resolve:
# Look for <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>
# Keep the version you want
# Remove the conflict markers

git add <resolved-file>
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
```

### **Problem: "Accidentally committed sensitive data"**

**Solution:**
- **Stop immediately!**
- **Don't push if you haven't yet!**
- See [SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md](SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md) "Emergency" section
- Follow the detailed recovery steps

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Commit Often**
   - Small, logical commits are better than large ones
   - Easy to review, easy to revert if needed
   - Descriptive commit messages help future you

2. **Test Before Pushing**
   - Quick test on External PC
   - Catch obvious issues early
   - Internal Server testing is for integration with real services

3. **Use Descriptive Messages**
   - Good: "Fix: Azure AD token validation for production environment"
   - Bad: "fix", "update", "test"

4. **Keep Workflow Simple**
   - Don't overcomplicate with branches (for now)
   - Same code everywhere, different configuration
   - Only use branches if truly needed

5. **Document Decisions**
   - If you make a configuration change, note why
   - If you encounter a weird bug, document the solution
   - Future you will thank present you
